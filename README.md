Project for Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree

This is a project I created for the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree. The goal was to build a pipeline of image processing functions that takes a road image / video as input and outputs the image / video with lane lines marked with straight red lines.
